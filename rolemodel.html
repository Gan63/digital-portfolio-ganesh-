        <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>Suresh Kumar Raina was born in Muradnagar of Uttar Pradesh on 27 November 1986 into a Kashmiri Pandit family,
            to parents from Rainawari, Srinagar district of Jammu and Kashmir. Raina lives in the Rajnagar neighborhood
            of Ghaziabad city. He has an older brother, Dinesh Raina. He studied in a boarding school
        </p>
        <h2>PLAYING STYLE</h2>
        <P>Raina is an attacking middle order left handed batter. He had more success in limited over cricket than in
            test. He has weakness of short pitched balls and throughout his career opposition teams tried to exploit
            this weakness.[21] Also in Ranji trophy he has struggled against short balls.[59] He has been widely
            criticised for his short ball weakness. He is part time off break bowler. His favourite scoring area is mid
            wickets on side. Most of the times he plays inside out off drive shot. While trying to hit on off side, he
            creates room for himself. He is particularly strong on the leg side, where he employs a wide array of shots,
            including the flick, pull, and slog sweep.[60]

            In addition to his batting skills, Raina is an exceptional fielder, renowned for his agility, sharp
            reflexes, and throwing accuracy. He is often stationed in the inner ring, saving runs and effecting crucial
            run-outs. Former South African Cricketer Jonty Rhodes has ranked Suresh Raina as Number 1 in his 'top
            fielders</P>

        <h2>IPL CAREER</h2>
        <P>
            Raina was the backbone of Chennai Super Kings' success. His dashing left-hand style of play at No. 3 gave
            CSK the luxury to attack at will with a lot of firepower left down the order. The fact that he is currently
            the highest run-getter in the history of IPL (4985 runs before start of IPL 12) explains the magnanimity of
            Raina's contribution to the side and he is aptly nicknamed \"Chinna Thala\" by the CSK fans. The lofted
            straight drive (or hitting in the V) is a shot fans savour to watch as he audaciously plays without fear in
            a tournament like IPL. He recorded his highest-score in IPL - 100 not out against Kings XI Punjab in 2013 in
            Chennai, but his blitzkrieg (87 runs off just 25 balls) against KXIP in Qualifier 2 in 2015 standouts
            amongst all of his IPL performances.

            Raina also bowls very useful right-arm off spin and was often used by Dhoni when he had to look for
            breakthroughs or try something different. However, he has not been bowling of late with many other options
            being available for the captain. When CSK faced a two-year exile after the 2015 season, Raina captained the
            temporary franchise Gujarat Lions as well. When CSK returned from the hiatus, he was one of the three
            players retained by the franchise . He has been one of the greats in IPL history, referred fondly as
            'Mr.IPL' due to his dominance in the tournament, where he has scored in excess of 400 runs every year,
            barring two seasons.
